There are 6 files to check in task 3:

1, neural_network.py - A python file contains the network architecture.
2. ppo_algorithm.py - A python file contains the PPO algorithm.
3. training_evaluating.py - A python file that contains the helper functions for training and evaluation.
4. testing_ppo.py - A python file that contains the helper functions for testing.
5. task3_ppo.ipynb - A Jupiter notebook file for training the PPO.
6. task3_testing_ppo.ipynb - A Jupiter notebook file for testing the PPO. This notebook import the best Actor model and environment to test.


- Check 'task3_ppo.ipynb' to observe the results while training (take long time to train).* 
- Check 'task3_testing_ppo.ipynb' to see the results (feel free to rerun this file, since it is very fast).
- The '.p' files are just saved file for the environments.
- The '.pth' files are just saved file for the models.


* NOTE *
There are three additional libraries that is used but not get mentioned in the CW_guideline.
Please install below libraries if you wish to rerun 'task3_ppo.ipynb' 
1. Optuna
2. Plotly
3. Pandas

- The 'task3_testing_ppo.ipynb' should still be able to run without installing the additional libraries.

- If the visualisation of the optimisation history disappeared in 'task3_ppo.ipynb'. 
  Please install 'Plotly' library and install Jupiter lab extension via
  'https://plotly.com/python/getting-started/#jupyterlab-support-python-35'  (Installation and Jupyter Notebook Support topics) 
  or see the results in the report
