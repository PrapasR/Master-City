# Master-City
This repository contains coursework I did at City, University of London for a Data Science degree 2020-2021. Most of the code is on Python except for the Machine Learning subject that is in Matlab. Please see the overview report of the topic I chose for each subject before going to the code section. Some of the code is in Google Colab and has not been downloaded to Github, but can be found in the below link.
